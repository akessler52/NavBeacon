    A Tiled Map with Beacons placed based on latitude and longitude with user position being updated on the map with a .png image with a transparent background and a path for the user to navigate to rooms across while storing the door they entered from to return them to that position.

What We Would Want To Have if Possible
    Smoothing between beacons
