# Detailed documentation + sample code

For my concern when I started playing with beacon I didn't even have a clue what was a beacon.

This documentation is the one I would have been pleased to have at that time.

This documentation is written to make your life easier and to give and you answers before you ask yourself the questions.

## iOS

iOS will ask you a bit more attention and configuration.

- [ranging (only)](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-native-beacons-manager/blob/master/examples/samples/ranging.ios.md)
- [monitoring (only)](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-native-beacons-manager/blob/master/examples/samples/monitoring.ios.md)
- [monitoring and ranging at same time](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-native-beacons-manager/blob/master/examples/samples/monitoringAndRanging.ios.md)
- [multiple beacons ranging full example](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-native-beacons-manager/blob/master/examples/samples/multipleBeacon.range.ios.js)


*Don't forget to activate bluetooth on your device.*

## Android

Android asks less configuration.

- [ranging (only)](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-native-beacons-manager/blob/master/examples/samples/ranging.android.md)
- [monitoring (only)](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-native-beacons-manager/blob/master/examples/samples/monitoring.android.md)
- [monitoring and ranging at same time](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-native-beacons-manager/blob/master/examples/samples/monitoringAndRanging.android.md)

*Android `bluetooth service is required` but depending your version it not always enough:*
- android >= 7
  - activate `bluetooth service` on your phone *= OK it works*
- android < 7
  - activate `bluetooth service` on your phone *= not enough alone...*
  - activate `location service`
